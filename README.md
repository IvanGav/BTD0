# BTD0 / Bloons TD 0 (BTD6 Clone)

To formalize this project:
- BTD6 has lots of strange features - randomness for example - that the game would be better without.
- BTD6 isn't well optimized. Any top leaderboard timed boss or late game runs will be extremely laggy.

I think I can fix both issues while having a little fun. With this project.

This project done with [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) - a game engine written in Rust.

No instructions of any kind yet, as this project is very early in development.
